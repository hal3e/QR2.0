# QR2.0
This repository contains everything needed to build, tune and fly an Arduino based micro quadcopter.
The base of the quadcopter is made out of a prototype PCB cut with a CNC. Tuning of the controller parameters can be done using a Processing sketch.
The quadcopter can be flown with an Android based controller that sends commands over Bluetooth.
